## Inspiring People

Some people deserve credit, just because they do. They have either inspired me to make games, or helped me out tremendously.

### Jason Thor Hall from [Pirate Software](https://www.gopiratesoftware.com/)

A very down to earth game developer, with loads of interesting stories of and about the game-development industry.

Interested in creating games, but don't know what/where/why/how/who?

My most favourite video of his:

### [Ian Hubert](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrdodobird/videos) :fontawesome-brands-youtube:

Ian Hubert is a 3D wizard, some say. He also mastered the art of conveying years worth of expertise and knowledge into bite sized chunks that let even the most professional lectureres and teachers look like fumbling mumbling book readers.

Watch his self-produced TV Show on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dynamo/dp/B07NSNC7Y1).

### [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://www.youtube.com/@StarTalk) :fontawesome-brands-youtube:

He got me into astronomy and opened my eyes to the wonder of the beyond.  
I've loved looking at the stars form a very young age, but never saw much value in it beyond the endless wonder.  
But thanks to public science speakers like NdT, I was able to find the beauty and mystery in astronomy that I was long seeking for.
