!!! warning "Work in Progress"

    This website is still pretty empty. You must've found it by accident?!
    Anyway, I'm here to make games. Right now, I'm working on a [SETI inspired game]

# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my website!  
I'm Tanis, a passionate indie game developer in my 30s and I've been making some _small-side-project games_ for the past few years.  
I'd love to create some _full-fledged games_ and share them with the world, which is why I made this website. Some of my previous projects have reached over 40k downloads and even received positive feedback. Which I couldn't be more happy about!  
Now I'm back with more time and energy to create new and exciting games for you. I hope you'll enjoy playing them as much as I enjoy making them. Feel free to browse around, check out [my portfolio], and [contact me] if you have any questions or suggestions.  
Thank you for visiting and have fun!
