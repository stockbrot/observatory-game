!!! error "Work in Progress"

    This website is still pretty empty. You must've found it by accident?!
    Anyway, I'm here to make games. Right now, I'm working on a [SETI inspired game](game/index.md)

# Welcome

Hey there,
My name is Tanis. I'm a 30+ year old indie game developer.
I finally have time to get back into game development again, after my first few attempts were rather decently successful. I didn't make any money off of it, but at least 40k people enjoyed themselves. I think. :D

You can find my games [Package Man] and [SunDay] on my [itch.io].
